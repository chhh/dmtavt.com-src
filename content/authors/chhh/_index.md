Best way to describe myself would be: 
a software engineer with a lot of hands on experience in mass-spectrometry
(liquid and gas chromatography, ion mobility).

Usual course of action - acquire new data, explore it with visualizations,
come up with a suitable processing algorithm. In most cases this results in
desktop GUI applications for the viz part and CLI programs to perform batch
data processing.

- Prefer writing code in Java or C#, with occasional 
forays into C++.
- Contributing to Open Source projects like 
[Apache NetBeans](https://netbeans.apache.org/).
- Sharing love through Maven Central.  
- Daily drivers: Java, Gradle, Maven, C# (NET Standard 2.0), Git, SQL  
- Occasional usage: R, Python, Nodejs, React, Hugo, Gatsby and much more
